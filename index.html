            <h1>Happy Teacher's Day</h1>
            <p>
                It is with eagerness that we celebrate this special day, Teacher's Day,
                <br>
                A day on which our teachers, will be gifted a card (Not my idea), to show our gratitude.
                <br>
                A day on which we thank you for all you do to guide us on a path of uncertainty.
                <br>

            <h2>Poem</h2>
            <p>
                " When I began your class I think I knew
                The kind of challenges you'd make me face.
                You gave me motivation to pursue
                The best, and to reject the commonplace.
                Your thinking really opened up my mind.
                With wisdom, style and grace, you made me see,
                That what I'd choose to seek, I'd surely find;
                You shook me out of my complacency.
                I thank you now for everything you've done;
                What you have taught me I will not outgrow.
                Your kind attention touched my mind and heart "

                    <p>Well I couldn't just miss the opportunity to insert my other works, after all, I am as

                        Note: AudioBeats is still in unstable stage, it will not be updated unless I get enough
                        confidence to go and re-write this sphagetti code.

                        I will say again, it is extremely buggy, it was my first project that really introduced
                        me
                        to javascript and other things, the javascript code is a living nightmare, no comments
                        and
                        not even documentation of how anything works, here the tutorial I used:
                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXWvfrmpapI">Tutorial</a>
                        <br>
                        I tweaked the code and played around, that's how I ended up having this monstrosity.
