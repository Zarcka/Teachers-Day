            <h1>Happy Teacher's Day</h1>
            <p>
                It is with eagerness that we celebrate this special day, Teacher's Day,
                <br>
                A day on which our teachers, will be given an appreciation note, to show our gratitude.
                <br>
                To other staff members of this establishment that may not have the title of "teacher", we still appreciate your work,
                <br>
                (Thanks for the person who fixed our door, sorry for this inconvenience, and sorry for our class being so unclean, I don't know why exactly, but we will see how the class is kept for the next days, hopefully cleaner)
                <br>
                A day on which we thank you for all you do to guide us on a path of uncertainty.

                " When I began your class I think I knew
                The kind of challenges you'd make me face.
                You gave me motivation to pursue
                The best, and to reject the commonplace.
                Your thinking really opened up my mind.
                With wisdom, style and grace, you made me see,
                That what I'd choose to seek, I'd surely find;
                You shook me out of my complacency.
                I thank you now for everything you've done;
                What you have taught me I will not outgrow.
                Your kind attention touched my mind and heart "
