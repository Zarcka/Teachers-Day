                        <p>Here is the code for this project, free to check, pull and many other things that Github

                    <p>Shameless promotion here!</p>
                    <p>Well I couldn't just miss the opportunity to insert my other works, after all, I am as
                        flawed as my code.</p>
                    <br>
                    <a href="https://audiobeats.zarcka.repl.co/"> AudioBeats </a>
                    <p>
                        Note: AudioBeats is still in unstable stage, it will not be updated unless I get enough
                        confidence to go and re-write this sphagetti code.

                        I will say again, it is extremely buggy, it was my first project that really introduced
                        me
                        to javascript and other things, the javascript code is a living nightmare, no comments
                        and
                        not even documentation of how anything works, here the tutorial I used:
                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXWvfrmpapI">Tutorial</a>
                        <br>
                        I tweaked the code and played around, that's how I ended up having this monstrosity.
