            <h1>Happy Teacher's Day</h1>
            <p>
                I recognize today that Teachers are undoubtedly the backbone of the society.
                <br>
                They play a big role in building the character of students and teach them how to harness life to the
                fullest.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thank you teacher, for being selfless, always devoted and hardworking to shape the society and I realise
                how noble you are in inspiring others.
            </p>
            <p>
                Dear Teacher, without you, we would have been lost.
                <br>
                Because of your proper vision, knowledge and experience, intertwined with your willingness to be present
                by us at all
                times, you have given us all the reasons to dream big.
            </p>
            <p>
                You may not have a big bank balance Sir/Madam, but I ascertain that, to our eyes, you represent a bank
                vault - a source of inspiration for our development and shaping our future.

            <h2>Poem</h2>
            <p>
                " When I began your class I think I knew
                The kind of challenges you'd make me face.
                You gave me motivation to pursue
                The best, and to reject the commonplace.
                Your thinking really opened up my mind.
                With wisdom, style and grace, you made me see,
                That what I'd choose to seek, I'd surely find;
                You shook me out of my complacency.
                I thank you now for everything you've done;
                What you have taught me I will not outgrow.
                Your kind attention touched my mind and heart "

                Teacher's Day,
                <br>
                A day on which our teachers, will be given an appreciation note, to show our gratitude.
                <br>
                To other staff members of this establishment that may not have the title of 'teacher', we still
                appreciate your work,
            </p>
            <p>
                (Thanks for the person who fixed our door, sorry for this inconvenience, and sorry for our class being
                so unclean,
                <br>
                I don't know why exactly, but we will see how the class is kept for the next days, hopefully cleaner)
            </p>
            <p>A day on which we thank you for all you do to guide us on a path of uncertainty.</p>
